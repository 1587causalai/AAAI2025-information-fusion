  abstract={In this article, we develop new methods for estimating average treatment effects in observational studies, in settings with more than two treatment levels, assuming unconfoundedness given pretreatment variables. We emphasize propensity score subclassification and matching methods which have been among the most popular methods in the binary treatment literature. Whereas the literature has suggested that these particular propensity‐based methods do not naturally extend to the multi‐level treatment case, we show, using the concept of weak unconfoundedness and the notion of the generalized propensity score, that adjusting for a scalar function of the pretreatment variables removes all biases associated with observed pretreatment variables. We apply the proposed methods to an analysis of the effect of treatments for fibromyalgia. We also carry out a simulation study to assess the finite sample performance of the methods relative to previously proposed methods.},

abstract = {We present a new approach to the problems of evaluating and learning personalized
decision policies from observational data of past contexts, decisions, and outcomes.
Only the outcome of the enacted decision is available and the historical policy is
unknown. These problems arise in personalized medicine using electronic health records
and in internet advertising. Existing approaches use inverse propensity weighting
(or, doubly robust versions) to make historical outcome (or, residual) data look like
it were generated by a new policy being evaluated or learned. But this relies on a
plug-in approach that rejects data points with a decision that disagrees with the
new policy, leading to high variance estimates and ineffective learning. We propose
a new, balance-based approach that too makes the data look like the new policy but
does so directly by finding weights that optimize for balance between the weighted
data and the target policy in the given, finite sample, which is equivalent to minimizing
worst-case or posterior conditional mean square error. Our policy learner proceeds
as a two-level optimization problem over policies and weights. We demonstrate that
this approach markedly outperforms existing ones both in evaluation and learning,
which is unsurprising given the wider support of balance-based weights. We establish
extensive theoretical consistency guarantees and regret bounds that support this empirical
success.},

abstract = {Debiased recommendation has recently attracted increasing attention from both industry and academic communities. Traditional models mostly rely on the inverse propensity score (IPS), which can be hard to estimate and may suffer from the high variance issue. To alleviate these problems, in this article, we propose a novel debiased recommendation framework based on user feature balancing. The general idea is to introduce a projection function to adjust user feature distributions, such that the ideal unbiased learning objective can be upper bounded by a solvable objective purely based on the offline dataset. In the upper bound, the projected user distributions are expected to be equal given different items. From the causal inference perspective, this requirement aims to remove the causal relation from the user to the item, which enables us to achieve unbiased recommendation, bypassing the computation of IPS. To efficiently balance the user distributions upon each item pair, we propose three strategies, including clipping, sampling, and adversarial learning to improve the training process. For more robust optimization, we deploy an explicit model to capture the potential latent confounders in recommendation systems. To the best of our knowledge, this article is the first work on debiased recommendation based on confounder balancing. In the experiments, we compare our framework with many state-of-the-art methods based on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model is effective in promoting the recommendation performance.},
